## ArchLinux - Network configuration

## ArchLinux - systemd-networkd

## ArchLinux - NetworkManager

[NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager) is a program for providing detection and configuration for systems to automatically connect to networks. NetworkManager's functionality can be useful for both wireless and wired networks. For wireless networks, NetworkManager prefers known wireless networks and has the ability to switch to the most reliable network. NetworkManager-aware applications can switch from online and offline mode. NetworkManager also prefers wired connections over wireless ones, has support for modem connections and certain types of VPN. NetworkManager was originally developed by Red Hat and now is hosted by the GNOME project.

NetworkManager can be installed with the following packages:

- `networkmanager` -  which contains a daemon, a command line interface (`nmcli`) and a curses‐based interface (`nmtui`)
- `nm-connection-editor` - agraphical user interface
- `network-manager-applet` - a system tray applet (nm-applet)
- `wpa_supplicant` - cross-platform suplicant for wireless connections

```bash
sudo pacman -S networkmanager wpa_supplicant nm-connection-editor network-manager-applet
sudo pacman -R iwd
sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd.service
sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd.service
sudo systemctl disable iwd.service
sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant.service
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
sudo reboot
```

By default NetworkManager uses its internal DHCP client so make sure to disable the `dhcpd` service if it is installed on the system.

To change the DHCP client backend, set the option `main.dhcp=dhcp_client_name` with a configuration file in `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/`.

```bash
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dhcp-client.conf
[main]
dhcp=dhclient
```

NetworkManager can use `systemd-resolved` as a DNS resolver and cache. Make sure that `systemd-resolved` is properly configured and that `systemd-resolved.service` is started before using it.

`systemd-resolved` will be used automatically if `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink to `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`, `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` or `/usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf.`

You can enable it explicitly by setting `main.dns=systemd-resolved` with a configuration file in `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/`

```bash
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf
[main]
dns=systemd-resolved
```

Interactive UI manager of NetworkManager can be launched with `nmtui`.

NetworkManager can also be configured to run a script on network status change.

The following script safely unmounts the NFS shares before the relevant network connection is disabled by listening for the down, pre-down and vpn-pre-down events, make sure the script is executable - `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/30-nfs.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Find the connection UUID with "nmcli con show" in terminal.
# All NetworkManager connection types are supported: wireless, VPN, wired...
WIRED_UUID="4e4a9c21-50d1-3475-ab43-09f582b5ba10"
WIRELESS_ADI_UUID="1bde9f13-565d-4253-84e2-c4538464345d"
WIRELESS_ADI5G_UUID="eb7e84c3-07e2-4900-86d0-483b75ad4be8"

if [ "$CONNECTION_UUID" = "$WIRED_UUID" ] || [ "$CONNECTION_UUID" = "$WIRELESS_ADI_UUID" ] || [ "$CONNECTION_UUID" = "$WIRELESS_ADI5G_UUID" ]; then
    
    # Script parameter $1: network interface name, not used
    # Script parameter $2: dispatched event
    
    case "$2" in
        "up")
            mount -a -t nfs4,nfs 
            ;;
        "down"|"pre-down"|"vpn-pre-down")
            umount -l -a -t nfs4,nfs -f >/dev/null
            ;;
    esac
fi
```

In order to turn Wi-Fi on when the LAN cable is unplugged (for example when detaching from a laptop dock), and for Wi-Fi to be automatically disabled, once a LAN cable is plugged in again, create the following dispatcher scripy, replacing `LAN_interface` with the name assigned to the wired interface. The name can be obtained using `nmcli`. The Ethernet (LAN) interfaces start with `en`, e.g. `enp0s5`

```bash
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/wlan_auto_toggle.sh

#!/bin/sh

if [ "$1" = "LAN_interface" ]; then
    case "$2" in
        up)
            nmcli radio wifi off
            ;;
        down)
            nmcli radio wifi on
            ;;
    esac
elif [ "$(nmcli -g GENERAL.STATE device show LAN_interface)" = "20 (unavailable)" ]; then
    nmcli radio wifi on
fi
```

```

## ArchLinux - Downgrade packages

When using a rolling distro like Arch, sometimes things break when updating packages to newer version. When this happens there are several ways to perform a downgrade

### ArchLinux - Using pacman cache

If a package was installed at an earlier stage, and the pacman cache was not cleaned, an earlier version from `/var/cache/pacman/pkg/` can be installed.

This process will remove the current package and install the older version. Dependency changes will be handled, but pacman will not handle version conflicts. If a library or other package needs to be downgraded with the packages, please be aware that you will have to downgrade this package yourself as well.

```bash
pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/package-old_version.pkg.tar.zst
```

`old_version` could be something like `x.y.z-x86_64` where the last part is the architecture for which the package is installed.

### ArchLinux - Using Arch Linux archive

The [Arch Linux Archive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux_Archive) is a daily snapshot of the official repositories. It can be used to install a previous package version, or restore the system to an earlier date.

```bash
pacman -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/path/package-old_version.pkg.tar.zst
```

### ArchLinux - Restore system to an earlier date

To restore all packages to their version at a specific date, let us say 30 March 2014, you have to direct pacman to this date, by replacing your `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` with the following content:

```bash
#                                                                              
# Arch Linux repository mirrorlist                                             
# Generated on 2042-01-01                                                      
#
Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2014/03/30/$repo/os/$arch
```

Update the database and force downgrade:

```bash
pacman -Syyuu
```

If you get errors complaining about corrupted/invalid packages due to PGP signature, try to first update separately `archlinux-keyring` and `ca-certificates`.

## ArchLinux - Connect Android To Arch Linux Via USB

Install Android studio

```bash
yay -S android-studio
```

Enable MTP(Media Transfer Protocol) support by installing

```bash
sudo pacman -S mtpfs
```

For devices running Android 4+, this should do the trick. However, on later versions, we would need another package called `jmtpfs` from AUR repository:

```bash
yay -S jmtpfs
```

At this point, we have MTP enabled. However, it would still not be visible in your File Manager as it is not auto-mounted as we desire. To auto mount it, we need to install a package with:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gvfs-mtp
```

PTP stands for “Picture Transfer Protocol” and infact is the protocol on which MTP is based. When you communicate with your Android phone via PTP, it appears as a digital camera to your PC.

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy gvfs-gphoto2
```

Finally, for the changes to take effect, reboot the system

```bash
sudo reboot now
```

## ArchLinux - Rebuild AUR packages when python is upgraded

Whenever `Python` upgrades it's major version in [core](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/python/), Python packages installed from AUR might need to be rebuild.

To get a list of them, you can run:

```bash
pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/python3.xx
```

And to rebuild them all at once with an AUR helper such as yay, you can do:

```bash
yay -S $(pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/python3.xx) --answerclean All
```

If any of the packages don't work with Python 3.xx yet, this might fail halfway through and they might need to be rebuild manually one at a time.

### ArchLinux - Brother printer & scanner

CUPS is the standards-based, open source printing system developed by OpenPrinting for Linux.

Install CUPS and start it automatically system-wide.

```bash
sudo pacman -S cups

sudo systemctl enable cups
sudo systemctl enable cups.socket
sudo systemctl start cups
```

For the HomeLab I chose [Brother MFC-L2732DW](https://support.brother.com/g/b/spec.aspx?c=eu_ot&lang=en&prod=mfcl2732dw_eu) monochrome laser printer with scanner and fax functionality. The reason I chose this printer is because Brother is a very reliable brand and it's quite cheap to refill the drum with tonner.

In order to use the printer, the driver needs to be installed. The AUR package for mfc-l2732dw model doesn't work and since the driver is the same as for mfc-l2730dw model, I chose to install this one.

```bash
yay -S brother-mfc-l2730dw
```

Configure the printer in `CUPS`:

- Open `CUPS` by searching for `Manage printing` in your desktop environment or going to [http://localhost:631/](http://localhost:631/)
- Open the tab `Administration` an press `Add Printer` button
- Select the printer for which the drivers were installed for from `Discovered Network Printers` option
- Configure the name and sharing settings
- Select the name of the printer in `Model` list, and click `Add Printer`

Now the printer should be configured and it can be tested by printing a test page and some random text or image from web.

In order to use the scanner functionality of the device, the corresponding driver has to be installed. There are multiple `brscan` packages in AUR and for the model I chose, `brscan4` contains the correct driver.

```bash
yay -S brscan4
```

For network scanners, Brother provides a different configuration tool for each `brscan` version which has to be run with the name, model and the ip specific for the scanner

```bash
sudo brsaneconfig4 -a name="Scanner" model="MFC-L2732DW" ip=192.168.0.233
```

Brother has released a tool to enable scanning to be triggered by user interaction with the scanner itself (e.g., by selecting one of `Scan to email`, `Scan to image`, etc. on the scanner's keypad) rather than by an attached computer. This can be set up by installing the `brscan-skey` package and starting `brscan-skey.service` using `systemd`.

Brother supplies some default scripts that are executed when a scan type is selected on the keypad. For all options apart from "Scan to email" the resulting output can be found inside `$HOME/brscan`, with `$HOME` the home directory of the user running this tool (so `/srv/brscan-skey` if started via systemd as a systemwide process).

```bash
yay -S brscan-skey

systemctl enable brscan-skey.service
systemctl start brscan-skey.service
```

SANE provides a library and a command-line tool to use the scanner functionality of the printer under Linux.

For a GUI frontend the following two options will be installed

- [Simple Scan](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan) — Simplified GUI that is intended to be easier to use and better integrated into the GNOME desktop than XSane.
- [XSane](http://www.xsane.org/) — Full-featured GTK-based frontend, looking a bit old but providing extended functionalities.

```bash
sudo pacman -S sane xsane xsane-gimp simple-scan
```
